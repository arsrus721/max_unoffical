# WebSocket Chat Client Example

This example demonstrates how to connect to a WebSocket chat server, subscribe to a chat, receive messages, handle **ping-pong/keepalive**, and send messages interactively, all in one script **without using additional functions**.  

It is written in Python and can be used as a template for future projects where you want to receive and send messages simultaneously.
